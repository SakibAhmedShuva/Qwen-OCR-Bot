def process_vision_info(messages):
    """
    Processes vision-related information from messages.
    For Qwen-VL, this would involve extracting image paths or objects
    and preparing them for the model.

    In the current text-focused implementation of the chatbot frontend,
    this function serves as a placeholder. If image inputs were added
    to messages (e.g., {'type': 'image', 'image': 'path/url'}),
    this function would need to handle them.

    The Qwen AutoProcessor and apply_chat_template are generally
    expected to handle multimodal inputs based on the structure of `messages`.
    If `messages` contains image references in a format that
    `apply_chat_template` understands (e.g. by embedding special tokens),
    then separate image processing might not be needed here before `apply_chat_template`.
    However, if images need to be passed explicitly to the `processor(images=...)` call,
    this function would extract and prepare them.

    Returns:
        image_inputs: Processed image data (e.g., list of PIL Images or tensors).
        video_inputs: Processed video data.
